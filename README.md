This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
# Pokedex App

A modern Pokedex application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and the PokeAPI. This application showcases Pokémon data with advanced features such as pagination, categorized lists, and detailed Pokémon views.

## Features

- **Categorized Lists**: Browse Pokémon by habitat, species, and type.
- **Detail Pages**: Each Pokémon has a detail page displaying similar Pokémon.
- **Reusable Components**: All components are designed to be reusable across the application.
- **Abilities**: Abilities are displayed.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **PokeAPI**: Public API for accessing Pokémon data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Er-Mithleshsharma/pokedex-assessment-bookingkoala.git

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
